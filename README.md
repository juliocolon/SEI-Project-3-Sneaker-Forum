## Technogies 
MongoDB, Express, React, React Bootstrap, Node, JWT Authentication

## Getting Started
- Sneaker Forum, allows users to perform full CRUD operations on threads they create on different topics concerning sneakers. 
- Users are able to sign up, log in and log out using JWT Authentication. 

## Approach
Began with building out the API, then foucused on implementing the UI using React Bootstrap. Transitioned to implementing the user schema, and JWT authentication. Implemented conditional rendering based on whether a user has logged in and whether or not a user has created a thread.

- Segment the threads according to brand category and allow users to view a specific set of threads according to brand 
- Implement pagination
- Allow users to comment on threads
